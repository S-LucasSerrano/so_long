# so_long | slucas-s

I'm still working on this project, but it is almost done.
Next update will add enemies to the game.

To play you can do _make_ and then run the program with _./so_long.out mapfile.ber_.
Or _make exe m=mapfile.ber_.
Currently, maps can only contain the following characters:

| Character | ObjectÂ |
|-|-|
| 1 | Wall |
| 0 | Empty space |
| C | Collectable |
| P | The player |
| E | The exit |

Every map must contain only one player and exit, and atleast one collectable. And must be a rectangle completly surrounded by walls.

Feel free to check the code and contact me if you want!
